## Overview

Campaigns let you make thousands of outbound calls automatically. Define a list of contacts, assign an agent, set calling hours and retry policies, then start the campaign. Relay Agent handles the rest -- pacing calls, retrying failures, and tracking results.

Campaigns are processed by BullMQ workers, giving you durable execution with at-least-once delivery guarantees.

## Campaign Lifecycle

```
draft --> running --> completed
            |    \
            v     --> cancelled
          paused
            |
            v
          running (resumed)
```

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| `draft` | Created but not started. Contacts can be uploaded and settings modified. |
| `running` | Actively making calls. Contacts are dialed according to the schedule. |
| `paused` | Temporarily stopped. No new calls are initiated. In-progress calls continue. |
| `completed` | All contacts have been called (or max retries exhausted). |
| `cancelled` | Permanently stopped. Cannot be resumed. |

## Start a Campaign

Transition from `draft` to `running`. The agent must exist and belong to your organization.

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-host/v1/campaigns/{campaignId}/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ra_your_api_key"
```

## Pause a Campaign

Temporarily stop a running campaign. In-progress calls will complete, but no new calls are initiated.

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-host/v1/campaigns/{campaignId}/pause \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ra_your_api_key"
```

## Resume a Campaign

Resume a paused campaign. Calling resumes from where it left off.

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-host/v1/campaigns/{campaignId}/resume \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ra_your_api_key"
```

## Cancel a Campaign

Permanently stop a running or paused campaign. This cannot be undone.

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-host/v1/campaigns/{campaignId}/cancel \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ra_your_api_key"
```

## Get Campaign Results

Retrieve detailed statistics for a campaign:

```bash
curl "https://your-host/v1/campaigns/{campaignId}/results" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ra_your_api_key"
```
