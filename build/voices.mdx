The `voice` object controls how your agent sounds. Relay Agent supports multiple TTS providers, each with their own voice libraries and configuration options.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Value | Highlights |
|----------|-------|------------|
| ElevenLabs | `elevenlabs` | Highest quality, voice cloning, WebSocket streaming |
| OpenAI | `openai` | Simple, good quality, low cost |
| PlayHT | `playht` | Large voice library, voice cloning |
| Deepgram | `deepgram` | Ultra-low latency, good for fast conversations |
| Cartesia | `cartesia` | Sonic model, fast and expressive |

## Configuration

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "provider": "elevenlabs",
    "voiceId": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM",
    "model": "eleven_turbo_v2_5",
    "speed": 1.0,
    "stability": 0.5
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `provider` | `string` | Yes | TTS provider: `elevenlabs`, `openai`, `playht`, `deepgram`, `cartesia`. |
| `voiceId` | `string` | Yes | Provider-specific voice identifier. |
| `model` | `string` | No | TTS model to use. Provider-specific. |
| `speed` | `number` | No | Speech speed multiplier. Range: 0.5 (half speed) to 2.0 (double speed). |
| `stability` | `number` | No | Voice stability. Range: 0-1. Higher = more consistent, lower = more expressive. |

## ElevenLabs

ElevenLabs provides the highest quality voices with WebSocket-based streaming for minimal time-to-first-byte. This is the recommended provider for production voice agents.

### Models

| Model | Latency | Quality | Notes |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| `eleven_turbo_v2_5` | Fastest | High | Recommended for real-time voice (default) |
| `eleven_multilingual_v2` | Medium | Highest | Best for non-English languages |
| `eleven_monolingual_v1` | Medium | Good | English only, legacy |

### Voice Settings

ElevenLabs supports additional tuning beyond the standard fields:

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "provider": "elevenlabs",
    "voiceId": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM",
    "model": "eleven_turbo_v2_5",
    "speed": 1.0,
    "stability": 0.5
  }
}
```

- **Stability** (`0-1`): Controls how consistent the voice sounds across sentences. Set to `0.5` for a balanced, natural sound. Increase toward `1.0` for more predictable output (robotic). Decrease toward `0` for more expressive variation.
- **Speed** (`0.5-2.0`): Adjusts speaking rate. `1.0` is natural speed. For phone support agents, `0.95-1.05` sounds most natural.

### Streaming Architecture

Relay Agent connects to ElevenLabs via WebSocket for streaming synthesis. Text is split into sentence-level chunks and sent incrementally, so audio starts playing before the full response is generated. This overlapped approach minimizes perceived latency.

<Tip>
  Browse the ElevenLabs voice library at [elevenlabs.io/voice-library](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library) to find voice IDs. Each voice has a unique ID you can copy directly into your agent config.

## OpenAI

OpenAI TTS is simple to set up and provides good quality at low cost.

### Models

| Model | Latency | Quality |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `tts-1` | Fast | Good (optimized for real-time) |
| `tts-1-hd` | Slower | Higher quality |

### Voices

OpenAI provides six built-in voices: `alloy`, `echo`, `fable`, `onyx`, `nova`, `shimmer`.

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "voiceId": "nova",
    "model": "tts-1"
  }
}
```

## PlayHT

PlayHT offers a large library of voices and voice cloning capabilities.

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "provider": "playht",
    "voiceId": "s3://voice-cloning-zero-shot/...",
    "speed": 1.0
  }
}
```

## Deepgram

Deepgram TTS provides ultra-low latency synthesis, making it a good choice when response speed is the top priority.

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "provider": "deepgram",
    "voiceId": "aura-asteria-en",
    "model": "aura"
  }
}
```

## Cartesia

Cartesia's Sonic model offers fast and expressive text-to-speech.

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "provider": "cartesia",
    "voiceId": "a0e99841-438c-4a64-b679-ae501e7d6091",
    "speed": 1.0
  }
}
```

## Voice Selection Guide

Choose a voice that matches your agent's persona and use case.

| Use Case | Recommended Provider | Voice Style | Speed |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|-------|
| Customer support | ElevenLabs | Warm, professional | 1.0 |
| Sales outbound | ElevenLabs | Energetic, friendly | 1.0-1.05 |
| Medical/legal | ElevenLabs or OpenAI | Calm, authoritative | 0.95 |
| Appointment reminders | OpenAI | Neutral, clear | 1.0 |
| Fastest possible response | Deepgram | Any | 1.0 |
| Multilingual | ElevenLabs (multilingual v2) | Varies | 1.0 |

<Warning>
  Voice speed significantly affects comprehension. Avoid setting speed above `1.2` for phone calls, as audio compression can make fast speech difficult to understand. For elderly callers or complex information, consider `0.9-0.95`.
</Warning>

## Custom Pronunciations

If your agent frequently says words that TTS providers mispronounce (company names, product names, technical terms), use the `pronunciationDictionary` field on the agent:

```json
{
  "pronunciationDictionary": [
    {
      "word": "Acme",
      "alphabet": "ipa",
      "phoneme": "\u00e6kmi"
    },
    {
      "word": "SQL",
      "alphabet": "ipa",
      "phoneme": "si\u02d0kw\u0259l"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `word` | `string` | The word to override pronunciation for. |
| `alphabet` | `string` | Phonetic alphabet: `ipa` or `cmu`. |
| `phoneme` | `string` | The phonetic representation. |
