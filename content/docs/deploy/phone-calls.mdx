title: "Outbound Phone Calls"
description: "Initiate AI-powered outbound phone calls via the REST API."

## Overview

Outbound phone calls connect your AI agent to a real phone number via Twilio. Your agent handles the entire conversation -- greeting, listening, responding, and executing tool calls -- all in real time.

## Prerequisites

- A configured agent (`agent_*` ID)
- A Twilio phone number registered in Relay Agent (the `from` number)
- Twilio credentials configured in your `.env`

## Create an Outbound Call

## Request Body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agentId` | `string` | Yes | The agent to handle this call. |
| `from` | `string` | Yes | Your Twilio phone number in E.164 format (e.g. `+14155551234`). |
| `to` | `string` | Yes | Destination phone number in E.164 format. |
| `composedAgentId` | `string` | No | Use a multi-agent composition instead of a single agent. |
| `dynamicVariables` | `Record<string, string>` | No | Key-value pairs injected into `{{mustache}}` placeholders in the agent's prompt. |
| `metadata` | `Record<string, unknown>` | No | Arbitrary metadata attached to the call record. |
| `agentOverride` | `object` | No | Override agent settings for this call only. See below. |

### Agent Override

Override specific agent configuration for a single call without modifying the agent itself.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agentOverride.systemPrompt` | `string` | Replace the agent's system prompt. |
| `agentOverride.voice.voiceId` | `string` | Use a different TTS voice. |
| `agentOverride.voice.speed` | `number` | Adjust speech speed. |
| `agentOverride.firstMessage` | `string` | Replace the agent's opening greeting. |

## Call Lifecycle

Every outbound call progresses through these states:

```
queued --> ringing --> in-progress --> completed
                  \                \
                   --> failed       --> failed
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Queued">
    The call record is created in the database and the Twilio outbound request is initiated. Status: `queued`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ringing">
    Twilio has initiated the call and is ringing the destination. Status: `ringing`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="In Progress">
    The callee answered. The Twilio media stream connects and your agent begins the conversation. Status: `in-progress`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completed">
    The call ends normally (hangup by either party, or the agent terminates). Status: `completed`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn">
  If the outbound initiation fails (e.g. invalid number, Twilio error), the call transitions directly to `failed` with `endReason: "initiation_failed"`.
</Callout>

## Rate Limits

Outbound phone calls are rate-limited to **10 requests per minute** per API key. If you exceed this limit, the API returns `429 Too Many Requests`.

For high-volume calling, use the [Campaigns API](/deploy/campaigns) which manages concurrency, retry logic, and calling hours automatically.

## Response

```json
{
  "id": "call_xYzAbCdEf123456789012",
  "orgId": "org_abc123",
  "agentId": "agent_abc123def456",
  "type": "phone",
  "direction": "outbound",
  "status": "queued",
  "fromNumber": "+14155551234",
  "toNumber": "+14155559876",
  "dynamicVariables": {
    "customerName": "Jane Smith",
    "accountId": "ACCT-7890"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "campaign": "onboarding-q1"
  },
  "createdAt": "2026-02-08T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Mid-Call Actions

While a call is in progress, you can interact with it using these endpoints:

### Whisper (Inject Context)

Send a hidden message to the agent without the callee hearing it. The agent incorporates this context into its next response.

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-host/v1/calls/{callId}/whisper \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ra_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "message": "The customer is a VIP. Offer a 20% discount." }'
```

### Interject (Override Agent)

Force the agent to say something specific, interrupting the current response.

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-host/v1/calls/{callId}/interject \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ra_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "say": "I apologize, let me transfer you to a human agent.",
    "then": "transfer_to_human"
  }'
```

### Terminate

End the call programmatically.

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-host/v1/calls/{callId}/terminate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ra_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reason": "manual_termination",
    "finalMessage": "Thank you for calling. Goodbye!"
  }'
```
