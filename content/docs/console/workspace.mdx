## What is a Workspace?

A workspace is the top-level organizational unit in Relay Agent. Every resource you create -- agents, calls, knowledge bases, campaigns, API keys -- belongs to a single workspace. Workspaces provide **complete data isolation**: members of one workspace can never access resources belonging to another.

Think of workspaces as separate organizations or projects. A single user account can belong to multiple workspaces and switch between them freely.

<Callout type="info">
Workspaces map to the `organizations` table internally. The terms "workspace" and "organization" are used interchangeably in the API, but the console UI always refers to them as **workspaces**.
</Callout>

## Automatic Creation on Registration

When you register a new account, Relay Agent automatically creates:

1. Your **user account**
2. A **default workspace** named `{your name}'s Workspace`
3. An **admin membership** linking you to that workspace

You are immediately signed in and set to the new workspace. No additional setup is required.

```json Response from POST /console/auth/register
{
  "user": {
    "id": "user_abc123",
    "email": "you@example.com",
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "avatarUrl": null
  },
  "org": {
    "id": "org_xyz789",
    "name": "Jane Smith's Workspace",
    "slug": "jane-smith",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```

## Workspace Settings

Each workspace has two configurable properties:

| Property | Rules | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Name** | 1-200 characters | `Acme Corp` |
| **Slug** | 2-100 characters, lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens, must start and end with a letter or number | `acme-corp` |

Slugs must be globally unique. If your chosen slug is taken, the API returns a `409 Conflict` error.

  -b "relay_session=rs_..." \

```

  }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warn">
Only workspace **admins** can update workspace settings. Developers and members will receive a `403 Forbidden` error.
</Callout>

## Plans and Limits

Every workspace has a plan that determines its resource limits.

| Plan | Concurrent Calls | Team Members | API Keys |
|------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Free** | 5 | 3 | 5 |
| **Pro** | 50 | 25 | 50 |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Unlimited | Unlimited |

These limits are stored in the workspace's `limits` object and enforced across all API operations:

```json
{
  "limits": {
    "maxConcurrentCalls": 5,
    "maxMembers": 3,
    "maxApiKeys": 5
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
Plan upgrades are managed through the billing page in the console. Contact sales for enterprise plans with custom limits.
</Callout>

## Creating Additional Workspaces

Any authenticated user can create additional workspaces. The creating user is automatically granted the **admin** role in the new workspace and their active session switches to it.

```bash Create a new workspace
curl -X POST https://api.relayagent.com/console/auth/create-workspace \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b "relay_session=rs_..." \
  -d '{"name": "My Second Project"}'
```

## Switching Between Workspaces

If you belong to multiple workspaces, you can switch your active workspace at any time. This updates your current session -- all subsequent API calls through the console will operate against the selected workspace.

```bash Switch active workspace
curl -X POST https://api.relayagent.com/console/auth/switch-org \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b "relay_session=rs_..." \
  -d '{"orgId": "org_abc123"}'
```

The `GET /console/auth/me` endpoint returns all workspaces you belong to along with your role in each:

```json
{
  "user": { "id": "user_abc", "email": "you@example.com", "name": "Jane" },
  "orgs": [
    { "id": "org_xyz", "name": "Acme Corp", "slug": "acme-corp", "role": "admin" },
    { "id": "org_abc", "name": "Side Project", "slug": "side-project", "role": "developer" }
  ],
  "activeOrg": { "id": "org_xyz", "name": "Acme Corp", "slug": "acme-corp", "role": "admin" }
}
```

## Data Isolation

Workspaces provide strict tenant isolation:

- **Agents** created in Workspace A are invisible to Workspace B
- **API keys** are scoped to their workspace -- a key from Workspace A cannot access Workspace B resources
- **Call logs**, **campaigns**, **knowledge bases**, and **usage data** are all partitioned by workspace
- **Team members** can have different roles in different workspaces (admin in one, member in another)

Every authenticated request -- whether via API key or console session -- includes a resolved `orgId` that scopes all database queries to a single workspace.

<Callout type="info">
There is no "super admin" or cross-workspace access. Even if you own multiple workspaces, each workspace is a completely separate data silo.
</Callout>

## Viewing Workspace Details

Any authenticated member can view the current workspace's details, regardless of their role.

```bash Get current workspace
curl https://api.relayagent.com/console/workspace \
  -b "relay_session=rs_..."
```

```json Response
{
  "id": "org_xyz789",
  "name": "Acme Corp",
  "slug": "acme-corp",
  "plan": "pro",
  "limits": {
    "maxConcurrentCalls": 50,
    "maxMembers": 25,
    "maxApiKeys": 50
  },
  "memberCount": 8,
  "createdAt": "2026-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```
