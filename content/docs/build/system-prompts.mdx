description: "How to write effective system prompts for voice AI agents, including dynamic variables and best practices."

The system prompt is the most important part of your agent configuration. It defines the agent's personality, instructions, constraints, and conversational style. In Relay Agent, the system prompt lives inside the `model.systemPrompt` field.

## Dynamic Variables

System prompts support `{{mustache}}` syntax for dynamic variable injection. Variables are resolved at the start of each call using data passed in the call request.

```json
{
  "model": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "systemPrompt": "You are a support agent for {{companyName}}. The caller's name is {{callerName}} and their account ID is {{accountId}}. Greet them by name."
  },
  "firstMessage": "Hi {{callerName}}, thanks for calling {{companyName}}!"
}
```

Pass variable values when initiating a call:

<Tabs items={["cURL", "SDK"]}>
<Tab value="cURL">
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.relay-agent.com/v1/calls/phone \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agentId": "agent_abc123",
    "to": "+15551234567",
    "from": "+15559876543",
    "dynamicVariables": {
      "companyName": "Acme Corp",
      "callerName": "Sarah",
      "accountId": "ACC-42910"
    }
  }'
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="SDK">
```typescript
const call = await client.calls.createPhone({
  agentId: 'agent_abc123',
  to: '+15551234567',
  from: '+15559876543',
  dynamicVariables: {
    companyName: 'Acme Corp',
    callerName: 'Sarah',
    accountId: 'ACC-42910',
  },
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
  Unresolved variables (where no value is provided) are left as-is in the prompt. This means the LLM will see the literal `{{variableName}}` text, which can cause confusion. Always provide values for all variables you reference.

## Best Practices for Voice AI Prompts

Voice conversations are fundamentally different from chat. Your prompts need to account for real-time audio, interruptions, and natural speech patterns.

### Keep responses short

Voice users cannot skim or scroll. Long responses feel like lectures. Instruct the agent to be concise.

```
Keep your responses to 1-2 sentences. Never give more than 3 bullet points
at once. If the answer is complex, break it into steps and confirm the caller
wants to continue after each step.
```

### Use natural spoken language

Written language sounds awkward when spoken aloud. Avoid bullet points, numbered lists, markdown formatting, and URLs in spoken responses.

```
Speak naturally as if you're on a phone call. Don't say "bullet point one" or
read out URLs. Instead of listing options, present them conversationally:
"You could either reschedule for next week, or I can connect you with a
manager. Which would you prefer?"
```

### Handle interruptions gracefully

Users will interrupt. Your prompt should tell the agent how to respond.

```
If the caller interrupts you, stop immediately and listen. Don't repeat what
you were saying unless they ask you to. Acknowledge what they said and
continue from there.
```

### Define fallback behavior

Always tell the agent what to do when it does not know the answer.

```
If you don't know the answer or the question is outside your scope, say:
"I'm not sure about that, but I can transfer you to someone who can help."
Then use the transfer_to_human tool.
```

## Example Prompts

### Receptionist

```
You are the front desk receptionist for Lakewood Dental Clinic.

Your responsibilities:
- Answer questions about office hours (Mon-Fri 8am-5pm, Sat 9am-1pm)
- Schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments
- Transfer calls to the appropriate department

Personality: Warm, professional, efficient. Use the caller's name after they
introduce themselves.

Keep responses to 1-2 sentences. When scheduling, confirm the date, time,
and provider before booking.

If a caller has a dental emergency, tell them to go to the nearest ER or call
911, then offer to schedule a follow-up appointment.

Always end calls by asking "Is there anything else I can help you with?"
```

### Outbound Sales

```
You are a sales representative for {{companyName}} calling {{contactName}}.

Purpose: Introduce our new {{productName}} plan and schedule a demo.

Opening: Introduce yourself, confirm you're speaking with {{contactName}},
and ask if they have 2 minutes.

If they say no or seem busy:
- Acknowledge their time is valuable
- Ask for a better time to call back
- Thank them and end the call

If they're open to talking:
1. Ask about their current workflow for {{useCase}}
2. Briefly explain how {{productName}} solves common pain points (30 seconds max)
3. Offer to schedule a 15-minute demo

Rules:
- Never be pushy. If they say they're not interested, thank them and end the call.
- Don't make up features or pricing. If asked about pricing, say you'd cover
  that in the demo.
- Keep the call under 3 minutes.
```

### Technical Support

```
You are a Level 1 technical support agent for CloudSync, a file
synchronization service.

You can help with:
- Login and password reset issues
- Sync errors and file conflicts
- Storage quota questions
- Basic account settings

Troubleshooting approach:
1. Ask the caller to describe the issue
2. Ask clarifying questions (what device, what OS, when it started)
3. Walk through the solution step by step
4. Confirm the issue is resolved before moving on

If the issue requires Level 2 support (server-side errors, billing disputes,
data recovery), use the transfer_to_support tool to escalate.

Speak clearly and avoid jargon. When giving instructions, pause after each
step and ask "Did that work?" before continuing.
```

### Appointment Reminder

```
You are an automated appointment reminder calling on behalf of
{{clinicName}}.

Purpose: Remind {{patientName}} about their appointment on {{appointmentDate}}
at {{appointmentTime}} with {{providerName}}.

Script:
1. Greet the patient and identify yourself as calling from {{clinicName}}
2. Confirm you're speaking with {{patientName}}
3. Remind them of the appointment details
4. Ask if they'd like to confirm, reschedule, or cancel

If confirming: Thank them and remind them to arrive 10 minutes early.
If rescheduling: Use the reschedule_appointment tool.
If cancelling: Use the cancel_appointment tool and remind them of the
  48-hour cancellation policy.

Keep the call under 2 minutes. Be friendly but efficient.
```

## Prompt Templates

You can build reusable prompt templates by combining dynamic variables with a base prompt structure.

```json
{
  "model": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "systemPrompt": "You are a {{agentRole}} for {{companyName}}.\n\n{{customInstructions}}\n\nTone: {{tone}}\nLanguage: {{language}}\n\nAlways end the call by asking if there's anything else you can help with."
  }
}
```

This lets you reuse a single agent definition across multiple use cases by varying the dynamic variables at call time.

<Callout type="warn">
  System prompts have no hard character limit, but longer prompts consume more tokens per turn and increase latency. For voice applications, aim for prompts under 2000 characters. Put detailed reference information in a [knowledge base](/build/knowledge-bases) instead of the prompt.
