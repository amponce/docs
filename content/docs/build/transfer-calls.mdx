title: "Transfer Calls"
description: "Transfer live calls to human agents with warm or cold transfer options."
---

Transfer call tools let your AI agent hand off a live call to a human agent at a phone number. This is essential for scenarios the AI cannot handle -- complex issues, angry callers, or requests that require human judgment.

## Warm vs Cold Transfer

Relay Agent supports two transfer modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Warm transfer** | The AI agent stays on the line while connecting to the human agent. The AI can brief the human before connecting the caller. The caller hears hold music during this time. |
| **Cold transfer** | The AI agent immediately disconnects and redirects the call to the destination number. Faster, but the human agent has no context. |

## Basic Configuration

### Warm Transfer

```json
{
  "type": "transfer_call",
  "name": "transfer_to_support",
  "description": "Transfer to a human support agent when you cannot resolve the caller's issue or when they explicitly ask to speak to a person.",
  "destination": {
    "type": "predefined",
    "number": "+15551234567"
  },
  "transferOption": {
    "type": "warm_transfer",
    "holdMusic": "jazz",
    "handoffPrompt": "Incoming transfer from AI support. The caller needs help with a billing dispute for account \{\{accountId\}\}. They seem frustrated.",
    "agentDetectionTimeoutMs": 30000
  },
  "execution": {
    "executionMessage": "I'm going to connect you with a specialist who can help. Please hold for just a moment."
  }
}
```

During a warm transfer:

1. The AI agent tells the caller it is transferring them.
2. The caller is placed on hold with the configured music.
3. Relay Agent dials the destination number.
4. When the human agent answers, the `handoffPrompt` is spoken (or displayed) to give them context.
5. The caller is connected to the human agent.
6. The AI agent disconnects from the call.

### Cold Transfer

```json
{
  "type": "transfer_call",
  "name": "transfer_to_operator",
  "description": "Transfer to the main operator line.",
  "destination": {
    "type": "predefined",
    "number": "+15559876543"
  },
  "transferOption": {
    "type": "cold_transfer"
  },
  "execution": {
    "executionMessage": "I'll transfer you now. Goodbye!"
  }
}
```

During a cold transfer:

1. The AI agent tells the caller it is transferring them.
2. The call is immediately redirected to the destination number.
3. The AI agent's part of the call ends.

## Destination Types

### Predefined Destination

The phone number is hardcoded in the tool configuration. The LLM does not need to determine where to transfer.

```json
{
  "destination": {
    "type": "predefined",
    "number": "+15551234567"
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Destination

The LLM determines the phone number based on the conversation. This is useful when there are multiple possible transfer targets.

```json
{
  "destination": {
    "type": "dynamic"
  }
}
```

With a dynamic destination, the LLM will populate the phone number as a tool call parameter. Make sure your system prompt instructs the agent on which numbers to use:

```
Transfer rules:
- Billing issues: transfer to +15551111111
- Technical support: transfer to +15552222222
- Sales inquiries: transfer to +15553333333
- All other issues: transfer to +15554444444
```

## Hold Music Options

| Value | Style |
|-------|-------|
| `none` | Silence (or default carrier hold tone) |
| `uplifting_beats` | Upbeat electronic music |
| `classical` | Classical piano |
| `jazz` | Smooth jazz |

```json
{
  "transferOption": {
    "type": "warm_transfer",
    "holdMusic": "classical"
  }
}
```

## Handoff Prompt

The `handoffPrompt` is spoken to the human agent before the caller is connected. Use it to give the human agent context about the call.

```json
{
  "transferOption": {
    "handoffPrompt": "Hi, this is the AI assistant. I'm transferring a caller who needs help resetting their password. Their email is john@example.com. They've already verified their identity."
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
  Include the `handoffPrompt` with relevant context from the conversation. This prevents the caller from having to repeat themselves to the human agent, which is one of the most common frustrations with call transfers.
</Callout>

The handoff prompt supports dynamic variables:

```json
{
  "transferOption": {
    "handoffPrompt": "Transferring \{\{callerName\}\} (account \{\{accountId\}\}). They need help with: \{\{issueDescription\}\}."
  }
}
```

## Agent Detection Timeout

The `agentDetectionTimeoutMs` setting controls how long Relay Agent waits for the human agent to answer before giving up.

```json
{
  "transferOption": {
    "agentDetectionTimeoutMs": 30000
  }
}
```

If the human agent does not answer within this timeout, the call returns to the AI agent, which can apologize and offer alternatives (callback, voicemail, etc.).

## Caller ID

By default, the transfer target sees Relay Agent's phone number as the caller ID. Set `showTransfereeAsCaller` to `true` to show the original caller's number instead.

```json
{
  "transferOption": {
    "showTransfereeAsCaller": true
  }
}
```

## Complete Example: Multi-Department Transfer

      }
    },
    {
      "type": "transfer_call",
      "name": "transfer_to_manager",
      "description": "Transfer to a manager when the caller explicitly requests to speak with a supervisor.",
      "destination": {

      },
      "execution": {
        "executionMessage": "I'll connect you with a manager right away. One moment please."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Make sure the destination phone numbers are valid and have agents available to answer. If no one picks up within the `agentDetectionTimeoutMs` window, the caller will be returned to the AI agent with no resolution.
</Callout>
