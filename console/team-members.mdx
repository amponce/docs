## Roles Overview

Relay Agent uses role-based access control (RBAC) with three roles. Every workspace member has exactly one role that determines what they can do.

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full access. Manage everything including billing, members, and settings. |
| **Developer** | Build and test. Create agents, view calls and usage, manage knowledge bases and campaigns. Cannot manage billing, members, or workspace settings. |
| **Member** | Read-only. View all resources but cannot create, modify, or delete anything. |

<Note>
RBAC is only enforced for **console session** authentication. API key authentication bypasses role checks entirely -- any valid API key has full access to its workspace's resources.
</Note>

## Permission Matrix

The table below shows exactly which actions each role can perform in the console.

| View workspace details | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Create / edit / delete agents | Yes | Yes | No |
| Start calls | Yes | Yes | No |
| Manage knowledge bases | Yes | Yes | No |
| Create / manage campaigns | Yes | Yes | No |
| Create / manage A/B tests | Yes | Yes | No |
| View API keys | Yes | Yes | No |

## Inviting Members

Only **admins** can invite new members to a workspace. Invitations are sent by email address with a specified role.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.relayagent.com/console/workspace/invitations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b "relay_session=rs_..." \
  -d '{
    "email": "developer@example.com",
    "role": "developer"
  }'
```

```json Response (201 Created)
{
  "invitation": {
    "id": "inv_abc123",
    "email": "developer@example.com",
    "role": "developer",
    "token": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
    "expiresAt": "2026-02-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Key details about invitations:

- Invitations expire after **7 days**
- The `role` field accepts `admin`, `developer`, or `member` (defaults to `member` if omitted)
- You cannot invite someone who is already a member of the workspace (returns `409 Conflict`)
- The invitation token is included in the response for you to send to the invitee

<Warning>
Relay Agent does not send invitation emails automatically. You must share the invitation token with the invitee through your own communication channel (email, Slack, etc.).
</Warning>

## Accepting Invitations

The invitee must have a Relay Agent account and be logged in. They accept the invitation by submitting the token:

```bash Accept an invitation
curl -X POST https://api.relayagent.com/console/auth/accept-invite \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b "relay_session=rs_..." \
  -d '{"token": "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."}'
```

The accepting user's email must match the email on the invitation. If they do not have an account yet, they must register first with the same email address.

## Listing Members

Admins can view all current members of the workspace:

```bash List workspace members
curl https://api.relayagent.com/console/workspace/members \
  -b "relay_session=rs_..."
```

```json Response
{
  "data": [
    {
      "userId": "user_abc123",
      "email": "admin@example.com",
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "avatarUrl": null,
      "role": "admin",
      "membershipId": "mem_xyz789",
      "joinedAt": "2026-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
    },
    {
      "userId": "user_def456",
      "email": "developer@example.com",
      "name": "Bob Jones",
      "avatarUrl": "https://...",
      "role": "developer",
      "membershipId": "mem_uvw321",
      "joinedAt": "2026-02-01T14:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Listing Pending Invitations

Admins can also view all pending (not yet accepted) invitations:

```bash List pending invitations
curl https://api.relayagent.com/console/workspace/invitations \
  -b "relay_session=rs_..."
```

```json Response
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "inv_abc123",
      "email": "newdev@example.com",
      "role": "developer",
      "expiresAt": "2026-02-15T10:30:00.000Z",
      "createdAt": "2026-02-08T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Changing a Member's Role

Admins can change the role of any member in the workspace:

```bash Change a member's role
curl -X PATCH https://api.relayagent.com/console/workspace/members/user_def456 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b "relay_session=rs_..." \
  -d '{"role": "admin"}'
```

<Warning>
You cannot demote yourself from admin if you are the **last remaining admin** in the workspace. The API returns a `400` error to prevent accidentally locking everyone out of admin access.
</Warning>

## Removing Members

Admins can remove any member except themselves:

```bash Remove a member
curl -X DELETE https://api.relayagent.com/console/workspace/members/user_def456 \
  -b "relay_session=rs_..."
```

This returns `204 No Content` on success. The removed user immediately loses access to all workspace resources.

<Note>
Removing a member does not delete their user account. They can still access other workspaces they belong to. They can also be re-invited to the workspace later.
</Note>

## Canceling Invitations

Admins can cancel a pending invitation before it is accepted:

```bash Cancel an invitation
curl -X DELETE https://api.relayagent.com/console/workspace/invitations/inv_abc123 \
  -b "relay_session=rs_..."
```

This returns `204 No Content`. The invitation token becomes invalid immediately.

## How RBAC Works Internally

The `requireRole` middleware checks the authenticated user's role against a list of allowed roles for each endpoint. If the user's role is not in the allowed list, a `403 Forbidden` error is returned.

API key authentication **bypasses** RBAC entirely. When a request is authenticated via an API key (the `Authorization: Bearer ra_...` header), role checks are skipped because API keys represent programmatic access with full workspace scope.

```
Console session --> RBAC enforced (role checked per endpoint)
API key         --> RBAC skipped (full workspace access)
```
