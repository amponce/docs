# Relay Agent Documentation

Relay Agent is a developer-first voice AI engine for building intelligent phone and web voice agents. It handles real-time voice conversations between AI agents and humans over phone (Twilio) and web (WebSocket), with sub-second latency and full provider flexibility.

<Note>
Relay Agent is provider-agnostic. Swap between OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs, Deepgram, and more with zero code changes.

## Key Capabilities

  <Card title="Phone Calls" icon="phone">
    Make and receive phone calls through Twilio with automatic audio encoding,
    voicemail detection, and warm/cold transfers to human agents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Web Calls" icon="globe">
    Embed voice agents in any web application via WebSocket. Get an access token,
    connect, and stream audio in real time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Knowledge Base (RAG)" icon="book">
    Upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and your agent automatically retrieves
    relevant context during conversations using vector embeddings.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Agent Compositions" icon="diagram-project">
    Orchestrate multiple specialized agents with a router, shared context,
    seamless handoffs, and conditional transitions.

  <Card title="Real-Time DevTools" icon="bug">
    Inspect live calls via WebSocket. See STT transcripts, LLM tokens, TTS
    chunks, latency metrics, and pipeline stage transitions as they happen.

## How It Works

Relay Agent runs a real-time audio pipeline for every active call:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Speech-to-Text (STT)">
    Raw audio from the caller is streamed to an STT provider (Deepgram, OpenAI
    Whisper, AssemblyAI, Google, or Azure). Partial transcripts arrive in
    real time. Greedy inference starts LLM speculation on intermediate
    `speech_final` events before the user finishes speaking.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Large Language Model (LLM)">
    The final transcript, conversation history, system prompt, and any RAG
    context are sent to the LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, or Together).
    Tokens stream back incrementally and are buffered into sentence fragments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Text-to-Speech (TTS)">
    Each sentence fragment is sent to the TTS provider (ElevenLabs, OpenAI,
    PlayHT, Deepgram, or Cartesia) for synthesis. Audio chunks are encoded
    (mulaw for phone, PCM16 for web) and streamed back to the caller.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interruption Handling">
    If the caller speaks while the agent is responding, the pipeline detects
    the interruption (2+ word threshold to filter echo), cancels the current
    LLM and TTS generation, and returns to listening.
  </Step>
</Steps>

```
Caller Audio --> [STT] --> Transcript --> [LLM] --> Tokens --> [TTS] --> Agent Audio
                  ^                                                        |
                  |_________________ Interruption Detection _______________|

## Architecture Overview

| Layer | Components |
|-------|-----------|
| **HTTP + WebSocket** | Fastify 5 server, REST API routes, WebSocket streams for web calls and DevTools |
| **Core Engine** | Call orchestrator, audio pipeline, greedy inference manager, composition engine |
| **Providers** | Pluggable STT, TTS, LLM, and telephony adapters with a common interface |
| **Data** | PostgreSQL 16 (Drizzle ORM), Redis 7 (BullMQ for campaigns and queues) |
| **Events** | Internal event bus, webhook dispatcher with HMAC-SHA256 signed payloads |
| **Admin Console** | React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui |

<Tip>
Relay Agent's API conventions align with VAPI and Retell for easy migration. If
you are coming from either platform, most concepts map directly.
